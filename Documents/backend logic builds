Notification read functionality
-------------------------------
- if a notification is send, then user has to be notified
- when user opens app, we will be have a read_notification list data, with that we can manage read notifications,
- when user visits the notification page will call read notification api with notification ids as list
- notification in the system will be kept for 30days, after that it will be deleted, so id from read_notification will also cleared due m2m relation
